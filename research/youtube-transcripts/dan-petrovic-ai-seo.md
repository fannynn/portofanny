And the idea that there is a set of pages that are kind of like in that net and then from that set of pages some are selected and some are not.

That felt like the most kind of like actionable idea to me of like okay so there's a bunch of stuff about just like fundamentally how it works.

But that concept actually starts to point at what you might do about it.

starts to point at something actionable and measurable, which is

okay.

Well, if you can establish all the pages that were in the potential consideration set and you can establish what pages made it into the final response, now you've got a more actionable kind of feedback loop and evaluation mechanism to actually start like doing things because I think part of what I have problem with with a lot of the uh ideas in the AI search space is that they're just fundamentally not measurable or useful, right?

And so like yes there's a lot of things are changing right like AI mode radically different chat GBT radically different like it doesn't look like search but the bas what you actually do as a brand as a company as a business is like kind of the same right you got to publish content you got to like you know optimize for intents etc um but I think what was interesting of your presentation like I think it really started to like expose the idea of like okay well if things are different how might we react and that's that's the bit that I think is kind of most exciting to me personally um but you know I'm kind of skipping over a little bit of I think I'm also fairly familiar with some of the backstory. I think a lot of the backstory was also very well explained in the presentation.

So, you know,

cool.

Um, fantastic.

Um, all

right.

For those um who are wondering what we're talking about is u a slid show that I put together for presentation in Amsterdam.

Um it's something that I've been banging on for a while.

Um and preaching and trying to reinforce certain concepts um introduce certain terminology u provide a little bit of background.

Um a lot of people reacted quite positively to the slides probably took me by surprise because I've had a lot of different um presentations in the past but this one is like people like tell put some voice over this.

And I think that's the part we didn't quite record um earlier is where Tom uh brought up the fact there like yes there's there's the material there but um people want to hear what goes what goes on top can we have narrative that goes on top of these slides so there

yeah a little bit of hydrate that with some with some backstory and so on.

Right.

So um I'm going to go with uh Tom's feedback here on um getting more into the practical side.

So the first part of the presentation goes um through a bit of history um from me predicting us chatting to Google today u back in 2013 to um evolutionary timeline the way I projected it and a bit of history of how things have evolved over time. I'm going to do a nice little skip over that and let you explore those slides on your own.

Um, and I think one thing that's probably um interesting to present before we dive into the rest is [clears throat] I think quite quite important to understand is that okay so Google came up um or a department within Google came up with transformers.

transformers were picked up by open AI and they're like oh cool we'll take this and then they made GPT and then um they make some they made some arbitrary decisions on how they do how they will do the GPT basically pick 12 layers and 768 dims because it would train for a month and fit on a dev box no other reason I mean he wasn't going to wait three months for the training that was at at the end of his patience so Alec made these choices and then Google's like okay well they know what they're doing So let's do the same thing so we can compare the results.

So that's how Bert ended up with the same dimensionality and same number of layers for the third base.

Um which I found hilarious and this was like I only found out thanks to his tweet um that that's because so they basically made history.

Um so I think but the main point here is that these are not large language models.

These are small language models. I mean they've got 100 million parameters um and they weren't as capable as you would you would um imagine a large language model to be today or language model to be today.

So [clears throat] what we're seeing here is um size of the model stepping up.

So more parameters more parameters more parameters and this is the number of errors it makes.

So as you make model bigger and bigger, you reduce the amount of errors it makes until you make it too big and the model just memorizes all the data because it has the memorization capacity and so it learns everything for the exam but can't generalize when it gets in the real world situation.

So these models are useless um in in a commercial setting because they can only answer what they've been trained on.

Um so the the trick of the trade in the past was

create models slightly smaller less capable um so they don't overfit u basically they can't memorize everything and that was the conventional wisdom at the time um this guy comes along he's like I don't care let's keep training

let's make it bigger I don't care and um he basically um discovered not discovered but like reinforced the the notion of double descent so essentially this descent that we were seeing earlier that ends up in the rise and people stopped training or increasing the model parameters at this stage because of course it's going up.

It's just keep going up.

Um [clears throat] people just didn't think like what why would it start getting better after it gets worse?

It's really unusual behavior, but it did.

And um two companies among many others paid attention to what's going on because the writing was on the walls like

we can just make it bigger.

So it's just a matter of scale.

We don't have to do too much more complicated.

So So they made um they went from 100 million parameters to 1.5 billion.

And it's like, okay, starting to form coherent sentences, putting things together, and then, okay, let's make it even bigger and bigger and bigger.

And so, welcome to today.

Um, so the the downside of making such large models is that you have no idea what it what it does and why it does.

Like we know there's like an emergent property of it.

It can talk to us and it seems intelligent, but nobody knows why it does things that it does.

And we are SEOs in position that we have to work this out.

Um the thing is relax.

Nobody knows why they do what they do.

Um not even Anthropic [clears throat] Grock team doesn't know why Grock does the things that they do.

The Gemini team doesn't know either.

It's essentially too complex.

And some of these things are largely emergent properties, reasoning.

Um they can kind of like form ideas.

And so um I wanted to introduce the a concept uh sounds sciency but all we need to know about this mechanistic interpretability is um something you can do with open weight models and open source models looking at at activations looking at the circuitry and basically seeing what activates when you do what

we can't do quite that with closed source models like Gemini and GPT um but there are thought leaders um formerly um uh open AI Mira Murati who is now running thinking machines.

That's their mission to understand why AI does the things that they do.

And this genius here um that everyone should pay attention. I I presented him as the best SEO AI SEO in the world and he doesn't even know um effectively he's the hacker that understands the AI whisperer let's call him, right?

So he's worked at Antropic um uh well co-founders of Antropic but coming from both Open AI and Google he knows what he's doing.

So basically reverse engineering artificial neural networks into he's translated essentially why does it do what it does.

Um so [clears throat] um I'm going to skip over the fact that I train I'm just going to say I trained a large language model or smaller large language model just to understand how it all works.

So I basically done it from scratch.

There was no finetuning. I didn't take BERT and go from that. I just basically took noise and created something out of noise using mass language modeling.

But um saying that just to establish the fact that I at least know what I'm talking about in terms of okay

Dan pokes his stick at a certain point.

He knows where to poke the stick at.

He doesn't really know what it means, but I've got some some um clues um that perhaps not everyone had the luxury of the time and focus to be able to dedicate to.

So that's why I'm sharing this.

Um so bit of a trust me what trust me, I know what I'm doing moment here.

you've got a lot of credibility and you've built some cool stuff.

Yeah, I had to I had to like pump pump it up myself just like

Yeah.

Like believe what I say next is probably true.

Um because I don't like when the SEO industry says, "Oh, we're all AI experts now.

We've solved this problem.

We know we haven't."

Yeah.

Well, what I like also is like the the humility that you're pointing out which is like no, nobody knows.

There's a lot of things here which are which are true kind of frontier science, right?

Nobody knows exactly why they behave the way they do.

There's lots of unsolved problems.

Um, I think it's exciting, but I think everyone needs a dose of humility here, right?

Like we're all figuring it out as we go.

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

And there's a lot of there's a lot of great work being done in the in the industry.

um uh people contributing um yourself uh Mike me Andrea Alini um everyone's looking at it and we're all adding to different pieces to the puzzle trying to put it all together and I guess we can look at this as a bit of bit of contribution that I'm making.

So like let's scale it back to like a normal normal user experience.

So you type in a prompt u prompt gets um fanned out into multiple fanout queries.

Um Google is googling itself.

Instead of us having 20 tabs open, Google is doing it in the background presenting all that grounding um context in form of search results to the model and model makes the response and then um bolts on citations on top of that.

So the big complex query gets broken up into small constituent parts.

each one reflecting an aspect of of of facet of that complex query and then for each search query we get different set of results coming from Google and then we get a massive amount of um grounding results not all of these grounding results end up being visible to the model there's a layer of filtering in between so there's a classifier or a system that filters this through so when it arrives the model we're only seeing a limited amount of grounding results present presented to the model.

So you can you can frame it almost as a rearranking system that cuts off a certain most valuable um context and gives that to the model.

Then the model selects which ones it's going to integrate in the final answer with slight nuances between how Google thinks about it and how open AI thinks about it.

Google basically takes the whole lot and integrates it in whereas open AI does bit more selective

selective stuff and I think that's interesting perhaps to have a discussion.

So okay so Google Googles itself something filters the results robot makes the selection and then that is being supplied to the model for for review.

So two types of text input come to the model. [clears throat] One is the search results snippets, not the full pages, snippets from bits and pieces from from pages and the original user prompt.

So that forms the text input to the model.

Now this is interesting because a lot of people are like does schema end up um in the grounding situation?

No, not in its original format because it's all blended in as text or markdown and that's what's that what model sees.

Did schema contribute towards that ending ending up in in plain text?

Probably.

Um, it's helpful like if there was a price or a product review that wasn't necess necessarily in the uh userfacing stuff, but it was in the background.

Um, but it's a design choice, software design choice.

Um, so you can't generalize and say, "Yep, go ahead." Well, I was going to say I think there's a in my mind and I'm curious if you agree or disagree with my perspective here. I think this is a crucial step where a lot of things are going to change.

So today and I I think um like a month or two ago it came out that Google was using what they call fast search under the hood, right?

So when they do their query fanouts, they're not using google.com search.

they're using like an internal faster, lighter weight version of search that enables them to get the results back quicker and faster to be able to do this in real time.

Right.

Uh my opinion is that like you said today it's pulling snippets of those pages back as markdown. I don't see any reason why Google wouldn't annotate those snippets with things it knows about the web pages and things it knows about the sites, right?

So there's no reason why instead of using fast search, it should use extended search.

So it gives like in a JSON format the kind of information that you don't get on the front end of Google things like maybe a page rank and eat score, content effort score, all these things that we know make up the algorithm today.

So the model can make a better informed decision to choose which of these snippets to trust, which of these snippets to use, which of these sites are more authoritative than than another.

Um, and I don't think it's doing that today. I think today you're like it's pretty naive, right? I think like you described it basically a bunch of markdown snippets and shoves in the context window.

But I don't see any reason why this couldn't get a lot more advanced um as Google builds out more of those things here.

And I think as that happens, I think we'll see a lot more sophistication and nuance come into which of these citations are making it into the final answer.

Yeah, I think you're exactly right that this will continue to evolve.

Google wanted to start with the minimum vable product and build on top because they were invigorated by open open AI's advancements and they're like oh we got to do something quick.

Uh so they were activated. I'm very happy about that whole thing because it's it's doing a lot of utility for the for the end user.

Um one thing that's actually happened recently that's important to add as context is um yes Google is using u its ced web to supply results very quickly.

All the grounding sources are coming not from from the live pages.

They're coming from the Google's C of those pages.

That's why it's lightning fast.

And that's huge advantage Google has over open AI.

Open AI has to go and fetch the pages.

They don't they don't maintain an index.

Um and Google can just very cheaply tap everything.

That's why they're grounding everything.

You ask Google with with grounding enabled.

You ask Google is water wet?

Is the sky blue?

They'll be grounding that.

Doesn't matter.

So that they're really solid about determining to prevent hallucinations.

Um so one thing that um shifted u recently and I and I proved this conclusively is that um raw HTML actually ends up in Google's grounding um situations.

So whereas OpenAI might see a bit of a markupish like a markdown stuff um Google actually has access to HTML with you know B tags and divs and and things like that.

So there's a chance that um schema might end up in there.

But from what I've from what I've seen the raw schema um can get clipped because they do they do um and this is interesting work actually.

How do you predict how Google will take bits and pieces of different content form a snippet that represents you to the model,

right?

Because it like it does not necessarily want to show the entire page.

So

that's where like you have a tool that you just released for the progressive summarization, right?

Which I think plays a key role there. I think both Google and CHBT will almost certainly have a pipeline to do that in a systematic and repeatable way, right?

rather than letting some kind of wild west of like, oh, maybe we cut off your schema halfway through or maybe we cut off a paragraph halfway through, like having a more robust pipeline of like this is how you take a document on the web and convert it into, you know, short snippet, long snippet, full text,

you know, full text with annotated data, etc.

Exactly.

So, I love that you mentioned this because um the so when I release a tool, it's usually because I had a problem internally that I've solved,

right?

And I'm like, okay, let's help others and push that out.

Um what I don't do is like my tools are normally part of an automation pipeline.

Obviously, I can't give that away for free, but I I give you that one segment that that helped and here you go.

Here's some ideas.

feel free to steal it, take it, reuse it, or or just use it as a one-off uh one-off tool.

So, semantic compression tool um helped solve the problem of how do we make each uh grounding segment stand on its own legs when isolated without the context of the rest of the page to prevent misinterpretation of products, services, brands, and and the intents.

particularly um important for OpenAI and the way that they do things.

Uh just um days ago I discovered that they use a sliding window.

Um so the model is essentially not seeing the whole page.

Google has that luxury.

OpenAI doesn't.

So they're like scanning.

So you have this one window and they can sort of slide which part of the or jump

to a a line number um and to see to to grab that piece of uh content. I thought that was a little bit weird, but um it is what it is.

This is how it works at the moment.

So this is all presented as text output and then they bolt on citations on top to sort of ground ground the the generative output with the with world knowledge.

Um so that generated text ends up being that um link.

So that's what we refer to as the citation.

Within the citation you could have a brand mention as well.

Two distinct concepts brand mention and citation.

citation when you actually used as one of like when your actual URL was used as a grounding source and the brand mention is you don't necessarily have to be a citation but you could be a mention within that citation.

So just dismbiguate that and typically Google uses a little chunk like if you actually click on that you'll see it highlighted and that that tells you okay well they're using using text segments um to identify how to form these um snippets um internally.

Um,

and just to pause here for a second, if you go back to go back to your diagram that you had, um, yeah, this one again, correct me if you if I'm if I'm barking up the wrong tree here, but my understanding is that these citations is like it's like a like a bad crutch UX, right?

It's like they're like these little link icons, nobody clicks them.

They're out of the way.

Um, there's lots of kinds of AI responses from Google in particular where it says something that you'd love to click like a product name, right, or something, but it's not clickable and instead it has this little citation link.

Part of the reason that I think they do that is purely for speed, right?

So, you mentioned this idea that chat GBT is slower, has to go crawl the web, has to go fetch those pages and so on.

But at the same time, I find chatgbt's default response often has more thinking in it.

It has more cycles of thinking, right?

So it assembles the sources, figures out what the response should be, and then kind of intermingles the sources into the response in a slightly more natural manner.

Whereas Google, especially AI mode, is pretty pretty belligerent about only including links as citations, right?

And I my hunch is that they're doing that today purely for like speed reasons. I'm hopeful, and again, I'm kind of an advocate of the open web. I'm hopeful that like links will kind of come back into these responses as they figure out how to do that in a performant way.

Is that would you think that's fair or like is is there some other reason why you think the cit citations kind of UX is going to stick around?

Uh I have a a I've harvested probably millions of um citations now.

Um I spent a lot of money on that.

Um collecting citations is expensive business.

um because uh grounding um Google's model in SERs um costs 10 times or 100 times the normal generative answer,

right?

So um I don't know why they price it so high and I think that's why OpenAI and Google deal kind of broke and OpenAI is now scraping I guess Google.

Yeah,

we've seen evidence of that in people's search console.

if if if there was an API pipeline, this wouldn't end up in search console.

This was scraped stuff that there's no to me there's no other way to explain it. I'm not going to speculate on that.

Um, but it's it's clear that, you know, there's no commercial value in paying such huge amounts.

Long story short, I've seen a lot of uh citation uh mining uh data.

Um I I have a gigantic data set on that and I've seen evidence of Google actually linking to stuff

um that basically having that little tiny little link. I don't know do we have a Yeah, that that little thing.

Um but there's also a moments where there's an like an actual link within the text.

And here's a little useful thing for everyone to to do.

Let's say you're the citation your own domain.

All you have to do is put links, internal links to your own assets and that influences the actual link in the generated response.

Google will basically never highlight your product, service, brand name and link it to some page.

You have to do it on your end.

So if you have internal link optimization done properly and all your key entities are linked up, they'll end up not guaranteed, but they're more likely to end up in these generes as an actual hyperlink.

you're you're talking about internal anchor links or just internal links generally.

Um actually don't know.

Um from what I've seen there were like bit of both I suppose.

Yeah.

Um but I I'm particularly focusing on just a link from page A to page Basically.

Um, so let's say you your your blog page is a citation and on that blog post you're linking to a product that you're offering.

If if your blog post is the citation and the product is part of the citation content, that link that links to your product page will then be included in that rendered u model response.

You'll actually get a nice clickable element there.

That's huge.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Can we can we jump to our live search for a second?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah, because I think this is a really interesting point to me.

So, um I don't know if you'll get the same results as I do, but pull up a search for dinner ideas.

Uh I'll do AI mode.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Um

anything in specific or just dinner ideas?

Just put dinner ideas.

It's just it's So, so here's what's interesting to me, right?

was like it in my mind when it says lemony tuna pasta and it says sheep ppan chicken fajitas like they got to be linked somewhere like if Google decides to link to themselves that's one thing and that would be you know fine whatever but like this citation like UX I I feel like it breaks down in so many situations where I think if Google gave themselves a little more time to do some like reasoning somewhere in this in in this thinking they would end up with a better like linkbased UX here.

And again, I'm biased because I care about the open web, but like I feel like there's lots of situations where the citation kind of UX is just not good for the user, right?

Um

let's jump let's jump practical stuff.

So dinner ideas.

Um I'll I'll go into um into this and I'll go to expert citation mining. I'll just do um this create run. I'll put some entities in there.

Yep.

Single entity.

That's fine.

Um generate some prompts. I'll generate 10 prompts for that one.

So if I entered like 10 entities, I would and 10 prompts I would end up with 100 uh prompts because 10 per entity.

And then I go mine centations.

So I'll do uh maybe 10 rounds per prompt open AI and Google and and start mining.

So this will do 200 operations.

So while we're talking it'll give us some results um uh to look at in the um in the end.

Um so basically the point u I want to highlight is that once uh Google delivers um these citations and open AI we'll be able to see a key difference and this is the fact that uh I I think I already mentioned it but I don't think it quite um it was I made it quite obvious to everyone listening basically when Google does the grounding they will ground a single fact with multiple grounding sources.

Open AI will do a single fact or a single chunk, let's call it,

with a one URL.

It's a software design choice and then that's the frustration that you're seeing there.

So, for example, this is a this is a grounded fact.

Yeah, that's the chunk

that they're grounding.

And this segment is grounded with these two um URLs as citations.

If this was open AI, this would be

a single um URL grounding a single chunk like that.

Mhm.

Uh so open AI goes a bit more granular and they go one whereas Google does um multiple grounding sources and that's what makes it impossible.

How can you you know so they have one this one little thing [clears throat] and you can't really um provide I mean you could you could provide one two three you know like footnote style citations also not not ideal is it?

So they're doing this thing on the side.

So a bit of a clunky user experience there.

Well, and and I think that's what I'm trying to get at is like philosophically in my mind there's kind of this distinction between how the model is working under the hood, which you know is technical and has nuance and and and so on and so forth.

But then you've got this kind of like separate consideration of like what should a result look like?

What do users want?

Right?

And I think we know that there are lots of kinds of queries where users want links, right?

And this is a great example, I think, where it's like this would just be categorically better if each of these recipes was linked somewhere.

Even if it went to a Google search result, it would be better than what it is here.

Um, and how does the model is that just a better prompt, right?

Is that just like better prompting on Google's side to like tell AI mode like when the user wants links, add add links in or is there some technical limitation?

Because in my mind, I feel like the citation UX almost feels like a technical limitation more than a prompt design problem.

Um, but maybe it's a bit of both.

Um

yeah yeah yeah I think it's just their user interface front end team that the choices then they made and the best they could do in the limited uh spin I'm sure they're working on a better solution right now

and that's what I'm hoping too is like I I I feel somewhat optimistic like and again as an advocate for the open web and publishers on the open web like I think there's a lot of these kinds of examples that are already bad and don't have any links in them but I'm kind of optimistic that I think Google's going to add a lot more links back into this as they realize a lot of what made regular search good is the links, right?

Again, not not to like it's still going to spit out an AI generated answer and like it's still going to be different than what it was today, but I'm optimistic that they're going to put more links back into it in smart ways.

Uh fingers crossed because that's

fingers crossed.

Yeah, that's we're perfectly aligned on that.

Um evidence that they do put uh obviously put links in is that they are there so they can and and they will.

So um obviously so this is the this is the process and logic.

So you can imagine let's say I put 100 entities for a client

and I generated um uh 10 prompts for each.

So I've got thousand different prompts um synthetic prompts obviously

um and then I do um a citation mining.

So I do um 10 rounds for each one.

So I've suddenly collected 10,000 um uh each.

So I've got 10,000 open air, 10,000 Google.

and that will give me like maybe 100,000 different citations.

So there's a massive amount of data just from a single run to collect. I've been looking at this data set for quite a while and I did find instances where these links integrate like mids sentence.

Mhm.

And [clears throat] you just had to have you just got to have the internal links.

Um old school SEO, you just got to have the internal links present.

But like but like like bring that to life for me like on this page we're looking at here.

So for example like those ones that are linked at the bottom like do we have any in inclination as to why they were chosen why they were chosen?

These are these are the uh uh three of the grounding sources overall.

Um so basically

but not necessarily tied to the individual

no this is like a summary and end statement.

This is we don't have a good example of them using like an in in um right

mid-sentence link because it's in the content of that page. I'm sure I'm sure this website probably has um probably has like Yeah, there you go.

these internal links.

So um if if you have any chance of having these links show up, you have to have them in the first place.

Um so uh how do you how do you optimize optimize for for that?

Well, the link has to have a good purpose, good place already in there.

Um one one way I guess I keep people with like to give people something practical to do if I take this URL uh langird is a model that I trained that I can use one of the tools uh also used in the presentation.

So if I um if I take uh let's say go back to that URL and take this piece of text and see where links would naturally occur in that bit of text, you know, probabilistic wise.

Um, those are probably the most likely uh most likely spots nowhere in this piece.

Well, just my luck.

Um, let's try to lower the thresholds if it'll be a bit more generous.

Oh, there you go.

That's the first most likely link at the 50/50 threshold which is a typical of of deep learning models.

So from clever ways with chicken breast.

Wait.

So so break this down for me. I think I'm following but I'm not even sure I'm following.

So I'm sure folks watching this might be having a hard time.

What exactly are you suggesting or implying with this methodology?

Okay.

So um effectively this um deep learning model has learned where links appear naturally on the web and where where there's a good intuition good feeling this link is useful to have

right um so we've we've we've now lowered our threshold down to 50%.

and the first link that's appeared.

So the obviously the model hasn't seen the links or HTML.

So it's it's feeling out where the where in here is the best place for a link and it predicted that.

So if we go back to the page that's the the link actually exists.

So we could go we could go further and go like well lower the lower it further to see what else it'll paint as potential um as potential links.

So as we lower the threshold it probably loosen its criteria.

Okay.

clever ways with chicken breasts.

All

right.

What did they do?

They to pass the dishes.

Okay.

We basically predicted human behavior.

What this author was going to do.

We predicted this link and that link.

So, so, so again, so if I understand correctly what you're saying then is if you have a piece of content and you ran it through this tool, it would suggest smart places for you to add internal links.

Is that is that what you're is that the kind of workflow that you're implying?

Not necessarily smart.

It'll predict the most probable places where a link wouldn't appear naturally as per our training data.

We we trained our link model on TechCrunch Gizmag U the best of the best non-spammy.

We didn't train on link networks obviously.

Um, so how normal web authors would choose to place a link.

And this this is um important because um when you're considering how Google will make choices, they will reflect the same type of training.

Oh, the training data that that was a link I will make a link too because models are trained on the web corpus in the same way that our deep learning model was trained on the web corpus.

So they've learned when and what to create uh that to create as a link.

Um now with a important distinction, Google will not go and create a link where it doesn't exist.

It'll only choose when to keep a link that fits a pattern of useful links being on the page.

Mhm.

if it doesn't fit this probabilistic um pattern the link that's my running theory at the moment and it and it fits I I I test again and again and again and where links appear uh so for example I will find an instance where I have um links like that appearing mids sentence and I'll run it through the tool and it'll be highlighted in green

as you can see that like this one is a bit stronger and this is a bit weaker right so the probabilities of them being links um is varied right based on the based on the truth.

So we took a little um little side quest but I think it was quite valuable and

yeah I think this is super valuable.

Yeah.

Sorry for taking us taking us no like I think there's value for people already like look what to cook that's a link dinner ingredients that's a link.

So, if you're considering um how to um optimize your content for internal links, Lingird is your go-to model to and by the way, you don't have to use this tool.

Lingird is published on hugging face.

You can build your own tools with it.

The brain is there.

You just need to surround it with some scripts, Python, and so on.

Okay.

Um so, that um that gives us uh let's see if the citation centation mind is finished.

So, let's look at the let's look at the stats.

Um, so these are the top top domains OpenAI chose to include and these are the domains that Google uh chose to use.

Um, so we've got the top citation URLs um for Open AI and Google.

So Google out of that little run we did this this page appeared 93 times.

What is so special about this?

So the so we do two things in terms of optimization potential.

Create lookalike content that just hits the spot with Google the way this does.

Format style whatever they do.

Try to reverse engineer that.

Get in with content of your own that looks like that and hope to become a citation.

Number two get into these types of domains with the lookalike content ahead of your domain being in there because you you already know that they're being selected.

So just give them something that looks like this to them with your brand mention in hope to get this ability ahead of ahead of time without waiting for you to become one of those grounding grounding sources to get the brand mention hopefully hopefully the link.

Now here's the here's the um nuance.

So for the entity dinner ideas for the prompt uh whatever that is um the Google Google's grounding URL is that we get confidence scores as well.

So each confidence score tells us how likely is that URL to be of utility for that grounding chunk.

Um and sometimes it's a very high score, sometimes it's very low score.

Um whereas OpenAI doesn't give us the the um probability scores, but they give us um they give us the uh um something even better. I think they give us what they've browsed and chose not to include.

and they give us what they chose to include.

And that each one of these, of course, we've got the uh entity mapping, we've got the prompt mapping, we've got the uh grounding source, and we've got the exact chunk of text that that grounding um uh supports.

So, um if we look at the raw responses, you can see I guess a bit more clearly what that looks like.

So, this is the Google's response and this is their grounding situation.

So this is the chunk that was grounded and here you can see um that they uh for for a let's sort it by that uh you can see multiple uh grounding sources supporting the same um same chunk and vice versa.

So Google will will do that from time to time whereas Open AI they do more of a oneonone situation and so for each each one you only get um one grounding grounding support.

Well that's quite quite we have quite a lot of data in there.

Um so as you can see like it's probably not feasible to do human analysis and human review.

That's why we use tooling um to help with this sort of u sort of work.

But of course if you want like you can just get get to raw data of of everything and you can see what is it that the API response actually gives you.

These are just coming straight out of the API API responses or your not scraping anything here.

We're we're not scraping.

We're trying to understand the choices that models make

when presented with certain grounding sources.

Mhm.

And what do they what do they so this is all gearing towards selection rate optimization um and understanding the what the performance uh performance will look like.

So that's the that's probably the most exciting work um in the uh in the whole thing.

So that was a

and so if you flip back two slides in this in this presentation maybe try and get get us back on track maybe.

Um and I think maybe you have a different visual as well that might be even better.

But like I think this is a really important point because this was the thing that really jumped out to me from this whole presentation when I was reading it through was you know there's a lot of noise and hype and buzzwords and all kinds of LinkedIn hustle bros talking about all kinds of things about GEO and AI search and how it works and what to do about it.

There's some things that I think are very bad advice and some things that are uh maybe not bad advice, but very short-term advice, things that maybe work today that won't work in the future.

But this this idea that you're talking about here, I think is really is one of the most interesting and kind of like uh actionable as well, which is there's data available that says for the prompts you care about, you can actually see which pages are in the consideration set and which pages make it into the response.

Now, everything's going to change, right?

new models are coming out, new technologies, whatever, things are going to change.

But like today, you can see what was in the consideration set and what makes it into the response.

And I think that is maybe some of the most actionable insights that you can ground.

Sorry to use the word grounding, but you you can ground your strategy in um if you're a real brand and a real company, right?

You're not just chasing the get-rich quick and you're not chasing the uh the bad advice, but like there's something in here which is fundamentally kind of useful and insightful.

Again, to your point, it's there's still some some pieces that are a black box.

We don't fully know, you know, why certain things are chosen, why others aren't.

But again, to your point, it sounds like if you look at enough of this stuff, there are some patterns that emerge and insights that you can learn.

Uh,

correct.

So, this this is us um getting as close as we can to the concept of mechanistic interpretability um without truly opening up the hood and looking at the model weight.

So, we will never work.

But just a little bit of hint for those who are extra geeky.

If you want to look at [clears throat] the models that OpenAI's recently open sourced, that's an that's a glimpse into how they how their models structured and how they work.

Um obviously um similar to how Google didn't open source Gemini.

They open source Gemma.

Gemma was built on the same training data.

It uses the same language, same tokenizer.

Um to the token ids are identical.

Gemini and Gemma if you want to look at that how like it's the same technology.

So, I'm not saying um that if you look at Gemma activations and weights and everything else that you will see exactly how Gemini works, but I'm also saying it. [laughter]

Um I think it's as close as you'll get to understanding Gemini by observing Gemma's activations.

But this is super geeky stuff.

Probably a completely separate session and we'd need some perhaps some machine learning specialists properly um to help us drive that conversation. I I got pretty close to it.

Um wrote some u pages on it but decided to bring it back to more more practical applicable um methodology that my my people within the agency can actually use.

Yeah.

Um so um bit of context.

So when when we have a grounding source like that little chunk that was selected, we as users we see what's on the left.

Model sees kind of like what's on the right but sees it with more of an attention pattern.

And this is the ne next important piece of work that we focus on internally.

So the model um sees a piece of text like that like like what you what we see on the

right.

It it certain elements draw more attention to it and certain elements draw less attention to this different piece of text.

It's by design how transformers work.

It's an attention based mechanism.

They literally have a paper called attention is all you need,

right?

But it's not really text.

they they see tokens not even tokens like this they see token ids basically if you think of um Gemini's vocabulary each each word in its vocabulary is a token and each token is encoded with an ID so you have when what model sees as input is actually token ids which are then represented as vectors so each ID let's say 4232 is represented as a single vector Every single vector is passed through the layers of the neural network and this is where the attention business happens, right?

So certain tokens like events has a certain attention pattern and another token has a different attention pattern and the positions of those tokens in a sequence actually matter and um determine the attention pattern.

So if you proceed um a token with something and you if you precede it with something else it'll have a different attention pattern.

Um I know this seems sounds a little bit abstract but we'll get to the practical side of this and what to do with it. I promise it's actually actionable.

So in SEO we always thought okay understanding what Google does and why does it try to reverse engineer their algos and then control element of control right like link buildings um content technical SEO whatever else we used to do beautiful symmetry in machine learning space that I'd like to point out that we and and why SEO is the perfect custodian for AI visibility there's no need to um fantasize about these new disciplines And SEO is perfectly placed to take over this.

Um, understanding is literally the the term in machine learning is mechanistic interpretability.

Why the models do things and control they refer to as model steering.

And so I try to align as much as I can to to that.

So understanding is what we've been talking about so far.

We're trying to understand the models, but we're not yet to the control part.

So my my way of thinking about visibility tracking and this is where I'm I've got friends who work in with SAS businesses that do prompt tracking.

I disagree with that. I think prompt tracking is busy work or AI work swap type stuff.

Um I I think you can already distill the model outputs at the root level rather than creating busy work and proc do natural language processing.

So I'll skip quite fast over this.

basically um do the brand and entity and location associations and probe the model to say what does IKEA do 10 10.

So basically if you do this um seconds one after another they always give you different results.

Mhm.

Because that's how models work.

They have um sampling and they have temperature which allows them to sample deeply from probability space of the next token.

In this case, the model can only say one thing um uh at a time and he's limited to 10.

So I'm already distilling at the API level.

So I'm trying to understand give me top 10. I don't want anything. I don't want a sentence. I don't want to lose loose prompt.

Um so I'm basically providing structured output. I'm measuring what model says over time.

Our frequency of measurement is actually weekly.

So we look for for movements in this in this order of things as they appear.

So we look at frequency and rank and we're noticing the authoritative brains don't oscillate but less authoritative brains do oscillate in the responses.

So that's something that we can use.

So basically uh we normalize the frequency and average position.

So it's all on the same scale.

So one to zero to one um and we we use the product of of the two as the weighted score.

As simple as that.

And then we measure that over time to understand uh are you on top of mind a so basically how frequently you mentioned and when you are mentioned what is your position in the order of of things.

So considering this is all prob probabilistic and it moves around all the time.

So there's no there's no honest way of saying this is rankings.

It's not these are probabilities and you have to treat them as such.

And something like a weighted score that we use is probably a fair way to represent this without saying oh these are the rankings and you so what I'm against is like uh coming up with 10 arbitrary prompts or 100 arbitrary prompts and tracking them on a on a daily basis.

That's that's ridiculous as far as I'm concerned.

Um so once you have that you can do um brand influence and uh brand mentions and so on because you can treat the whole thing as a as a graph.

So basically we've got um so this tool is available everyone you can just log in and and and uh uh measure your visibility for free.

So model probing.

So this is what happens with with uh models when they do um probabilities.

So this is one of our clients Hawaii is a and then what the model will say next depends on its random chance sampling the most likely thing that we will say is company and the second most likely thing is German and actually this was a problem at the time and I'll explain probably why and then custom and then brand and manufacturer right so every time you say something that influences the next token so when you say company that's the sentence it's going to say to describe the brand when you say German it'll say that thing So every time you change a token, it says something else.

So and this works at every single token level.

So now we have sports and that's a junction.

The model has decision to make and it's like a branching of uh logic, right?

If it says sports, it'll say one thing.

It if we say team, it'll say another thing and so on and so on.

And you can see how this goes to infinity of possibilities because at every token you have another junction.

It's almost a fractal type situation, isn't it?

Um, but it's nice because we can treat this, this is a network of concepts that we can treat and run page rank and vector centrality things that we're familiar with.

So if you take a brand, this is a tool that we use to probe the models um called tree walker which runs the walk probability walk on all this um stuff.

So that's that's that same uh company that ended up in a prompt.

uh we ask the model what does this brand do without grounding no search results and then we ask the same question uh with grounding and then we ask the model to self-core.

So this is the context for this slide before and after grounding and then the model self evaluates how did I do and then we look at the probabilities of each token from the API response and we say how uncertain were you about each token in this sequence and so things that are highly uncertain are are bright there and things that are very confident are low.

So this is uncertainty chart and this already gives you a little bit of an insight as to what model is confident about your brand and what is not.

So, high confidence tokens are up there.

Low confidence tokens are down there.

What's even better, we get to see all the probabilities that model could have said, but it didn't because he only had one shot at a sentence.

But if we were to repeat the sentence, if we were to have the luxury of parallel universes, we could see everything that model ever wanted to say.

And this is the that space of probabilities that all the things that model model wanted to say, catering, food, distill, delivery, etc., etc.

So this tool that we've built actually allows the model to start from that junction that it didn't path not crossed path not taken can go back and take that alternative path and run that sentence and we do it again and again and again and we observe this is low entropy and this is high entropy these are high uncertainty moments so it's the tokens that continuously constantly appear at the bottom of the confidence level or a high entropy tokens.

These are the flip-flop points.

Model could have said one thing or the other.

There were three different things with equal probabilities.

This is this is the like for example about this the model doesn't think they're very innovative.

It was it could have said other things about describe this brand.

And one thing to uh to understand about this is that sometimes innovative will be high confidence, sometimes low confidence.

It all depends on the syntax and the structure and the the semantics of the sentence.

So that's something to keep in mind.

So we have an interpretive layer of that that shows you high confidence, low confidence tokens.

It shows you um where it varies in like sometimes it shows you 99% accur uh confidence sometimes drops significantly if it proceeds with certain patterns.

So this is like our first level of understanding what ruins the confidence of the model.

what things h so that leads to content optimization opportunities and and so the next level is basically entering um the the brand in in our system and saying list all the things that you think this brand does and we take that list and we come up with a list of competitors by asking it a separate question for so for each competitor and um and for the brand we ask would you recommend this brand if somebody was searching for that

Yes.

No.

Don't tell me the story. I don't want your output.

Model's output is restricted to a single token.

What's interesting about this?

We ask it yes or no.

And we only capture the probabilities for

yes.

If it if the model says yes uh no, we just ignore that and we look into its head to see what it was going to say.

The probability was oh no, what what the probability was for it to say

yes.

So in this case, the probability of it saying yes was 42%.

Um so this is an instant um probability um of whether this brand will be recommended if let's say this is in grounding situation.

This is one of the search results presented to the model.

What we're measuring here is what I call primary bias.

The model's training data opinion about your brand and its association with a certain entity.

This is the entity cater Brisbane and the model's association with this domain for that entity is that low but for this is that high.

So this doesn't mean that that's the exact percent that you'll be selected.

That's not your selection rate.

This is the the bias that this model has against or for your brand towards certain concepts.

Why is this useful?

When you're optimizing your onpage content and off-page citations, you don't focus on this part.

You focus on this part.

If this part is of commercial interest to you.

All

right.

This is immediately practical.

Look at that.

Um catering near me that so so low.

So that's the that's the um so you will notice how we're probing the domain towards entities, but we're also probing entities towards all domains.

So you can immediately print a competitive matrix to see which competitor is strong or weak at which entity that you matter for.

Um and then there's an element of uh uh confidence u mining in sentiment that that did the model pick up negative things or positive things about your brand in the training data when it was being um trained uh from the internet corpus.

Um so association boost we also have the tool for citation mining.

So you can actually see what the citation sources what for what uh uh whatever prompt.

So obviously this goes into the automation pipeline that I just presented.

So, we'll skip by that.

And and just pause here for a second if this is a good spot.

Like there's a ton of technical work here and I think there's a ton of stuff that is really great and amazing.

It if I can maybe put words in your mouth a little bit and just kind of zoom out.

All

right.

I think there's I think there's a really important distinction here, right?

Which I completely agree with, by the I'm 100% aligned with you, which is if you just grab a bunch of random prompts and you track them every day, just like you used to do keyword ranking in the old school SEO days, you're missing what is deeply different and new about this new world, which is that we're actually able to move much more closely back to what real brand marketing cares about, which is brand awareness, preference, and saliency, right?

which are the things that brand marketers have known about and tried to influence for a very long time,

ages.

Yeah.

And that you can actually get a much better understanding of what the model thinks about you rather than just what is the end thing it happens to spit out for this one random prompt that you happen to track every day, right?

And and that for me is like a critical distinction which I think is very interesting about the future world which is you know rank tracking in in old school SEO days was always an approximation of what Google thinks about you,

right?

It was always like but it was the best we had right the best way to understand what Google thought about you was to Google something right but actually now with these LMS

you actually have the ability to interrogate more closely uh and probe in different ways for what do you think about my brand what do you think about this web page what do you think about this website as it relates to different kinds of intent different kinds of use user behavior and so on um I I think that's exciting because despite the fact that a lot of what you just showed is kind of deep tech like it's like very like nerdy It's like technical, it's detailed, it's cutting edge.

At the same time, we are moving to a world, I think, which is much more like human- centered of this much more closely mirrors how humans feel about brands and how humans feel about web pages, which is uh that's kind of like a big innovation, I think.

So, um I don't know if I if I misrepresented anything you said there, but I'm on the same page as you that like this is fundamentally a better way to understand what's going on than than just kind of raw naive pump tracking.

This is why this is why I h I'm having you um on this uh screen recording today.

That that's that's perfectly perfectly well put.

In essence, what we're doing now, we're doing model psychology.

Yes.

Yes,

we're trying to understand the model's biases and associations um in respect to products, brands, uh services and so on to understand how its decisions will skew um in which direction when it's um in a situation where it needs to make decisions um when it's doing the grounding when it's doing the uh the synthesis of its answers.

That's perfectly well put and probably um cuts down all the complexity that happens in the background um to to a more um comprehensible level.

So all this citation mining business leads to um useful data that is immediately actionable for outreach purposes for content optimization purposes.

Um we've got some beautiful scoring there.

we've got some selection um decisions, grounding URLs, unselected URLs um which so if if we go back to that um moment, we in addition to um the the grounding and citations now have sources.

So the the missing link here and I've got this um happening at the moment.

We also need to scrape the targets and understand what they look like, right?

Not just your own website, but all the competitors.

So, super hack for everyone who's not aware of this.

If you want to get the exact um information about what Google has on any URL on the planet, you can just use Gemini's URL grounding API.

works in the same way or a similar way that the s um search results API works but you can ground with URL you can literally ask uh Gemini to give you intel on the page it's very resistant towards giving you the raw grounding snippets I have a hack to extract that out of it and an active area of research I'm not sharing that um because u it's changing it's actually changed today the way they do it and they have a blocking mechanism in place. I've made a mistake writing about this.

Uh I don't know if it's because of me, probably too egocentric to think that it's because of me, but they've changed something and they have measures in place to prevent models spilling its raw grounding snippets.

The reason I do that is because it's not it's not like this.

It's like this bits and pieces of your content are supplied um as a grounding context, not the full page.

Uh so in the visibility optimization cycle that leads us to so you've got your organic queries and their fanouts.

You've got the synthetic queries to close the gap.

You're trying to understand the negative bias.

You're trying to predict the value of different different keywords.

You're working on strategy to optimize on page.

You you you're mining citations in hope to build citations to get more visibility.

You're doing outreach for the purpose of entity associations.

Um and then you are working on selection rate alongside your clickthrough rate.

So clickthrough rate is for humans, selection rate is for models and agents.

Obviously they don't click so they select um um out of the pool of things.

So I introduc so this is this is what Dan is busy right now.

Okay.

So selection rate optimization how I think about it.

So we do the citation mining which we hope to um um improve the onpage optimization for better citation um stuff and we touched on that when we when you talked about the compression tool, semantic compression tool.

Um but we also want to do citation building.

So here's my workflow. I harvest the organic queries from search console. I generate the fan out queries.

From fat out queries, I generate the synthetic prompts.

We've seen that part before.

Then what I do is I extract the organic snippets, the actual snippets that appear to to Gemini in the grounding situation and then using that logic I train a model to generate synthetic snippets based on the synthetic prompts.

Right?

That's my setup now.

So I have the synthetic prompts, I have synthetic snippets.

So effectively what this gives me is the ability to um dedicate a selection model and present this model to something very similar to it.

Here's the 100 grounding results and one of them is my client.

Pick which ones you want and make a result for this prompt.

So, somebody's searching for dinner ideas.

Um, there are 100 results in the grounding sources and one of them is my client.

How often will the model this selection model choose my client out of the 100 results?

And how often if I repeat that, how often what is the selection rate of the selection model?

um when presented with these u synthetic grounding snippets plus my client and then I do the judge model.

The judge model will evaluate that selection, make a note and inform the rewriter model.

Rewriter model will actually don't care what it does.

It'll just randomly rewrite my client snippet, put it back in the loop. I think I think if you're if you're smart, a lot of light bulbs are lighting up right now.

This is basically CTR optimization on steroids,

right?

Because you can rapidly cycle through this process.

Once you have this pipeline in place, you can go insane speed of irerration.

So the idea is that you become from whatever five 5% selection rate if you're lucky towards 10% towards god knows what.

Like so the idea the end goal for me is to make my clients snippets when presented to the model absolutely irresistible.

It must take it.

So I'm trying to that's the active area research that I'm busy with trying to understand how do I get my clients to be u 100% selectable.

That's the goal.

Obviously you know 20% will do.

Maybe that's even overly optimistic.

But um so and and one thing to one thing to keep in mind is that uh this um is the the the presentation layer and influencing the model decisions to get there you need SEO.

So I treat all this as as SEO and that's why I made a point AI it's just part of what we do right that's why I made this point with this and um so um all these tools and you know that's just to help you get get to that presentation layer if you haven't done the bread and butter SEO optimization and all the other bits and pieces um you're not even in a mix

right you're not even in the selection right

yeah so AI presentation layer SEO the backbone and the memory layer of of of all these AI models.

Um, and what we're playing around with here is understanding the models internal um biases towards brands and products and services and understanding how to gear those towards um optimization work.

So um we can influence the the models selection.

So this is of course one part of the whole pipeline.

The the whole pipeline is a lot bigger.

So we just described by say basically selection rate optimization.

Of course there's the citation building um to get into the grounding sources um and also uh mention buildings to be one of the brands mentioned in other people's citations um doing on page optimization to be uh more attractive and making sure like you mentioned that your snippets are well optimized.

So when the Google's um selection logic that builds the snippets that go into the grounding CH when it's built together that it doesn't take your snippet out of context and it doesn't have the legs to stand on.

Each um semantic chunk on your content piece must hold its own ground and be a semantically cohesive unit.

So,

---

## My Notes

I picked this video because it feels like one of the least generic conversations in my whole research set. Dan is not just saying "make better content for AI." He is trying to explain how the retrieval and citation process actually works, where the model sees snippets instead of full pages, and why that changes what optimization even means.

## What I learned

- AI search is not just one direct lookup. Queries can fan out into smaller searches, which then feed a model with filtered grounding sources.
- The model often sees selected snippets or compressed pieces of pages, not the whole page in the same way a human does.
- Citation, brand mention, grounding source, and final answer are not the same thing. That distinction matters a lot for measurement.
- Dan treats AI visibility as a selection problem, not only a ranking problem.

## What surprised me

- His idea of "selection rate optimization" was one of the strongest ideas in my entire research. Instead of only asking whether a page ranks, he asks how often a model would choose that page from a pool of possible sources.
- He is very skeptical of naive prompt tracking and thinks it can become busywork if it is not tied to more fundamental model behavior.
- The idea that semantic compression can help each content chunk stand on its own was very memorable to me. It changed how I think about page structure.

## Why this matters for my project

This is probably the most "blow your mind" source I have so far because it pushes me beyond normal SEO thinking. If I build a playbook later, I want one section based on this exact shift:

from "how do I rank?"

to

"how do I become the most selectable source inside AI systems?"

## Playbook ideas I want to keep

- Audit which parts of a page still make sense when they are isolated from the rest of the page.
- Think in terms of snippet readiness, not only page quality.
- Separate citation tracking, mention tracking, and recommendation tracking instead of treating them as the same metric.
- Explore whether selection rate can become a better KPI than old-school position tracking for AI search.
